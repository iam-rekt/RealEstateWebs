The property listings page (http://www.pin-point. (http://www.pin-point.gr/en/property/search)

gr/en/property/search) (http://www.pin-point.gr/en/property/search) was not fully accessible due to potential dynamic content loading, which prevented readable text extraction. Based on standard practices for real estate websites, the following structure is assumed:

 •  Displays a list or grid of properties, each with:
  •  Thumbnail image.
  •  Price (in Euros, €).
  •  Size (in square meters, sq.m.).
  •  Location (likely including the area or address).

 •  Sorting Options: May allow sorting by price, size, date listed, or other criteria.

•  Title: Property name or identifier for clarity.
•  Description: Detailed text describing the property, including highlights and features.

•  Property Request: A form or page for users to request a specific type of property, possibly including criteria like location, price range, and size, to assist in finding matches.
Assumptions and Limitations
The analysis faced limitations due to the inability to access the property listings page (http://www.pin-point.gr/en/property/search) (http://www.pin-point.gr/en/property/search) fully, likely due to dynamic content loading via JavaScript. This suggests that the website may rely heavily on client-side rendering, which could affect rebuild efforts. The structure of this page and property detail pages is based on industry standards and may require further verification.
Additionally, the absence of explicit navigation menus or footer links on the homepage is unusual, suggesting either minimal navigation or hidden elements not captured in the analysis. The assumed additional pages (About Us, Contact, etc.) are inferred from typical real estate website practices and may need confirmation.
